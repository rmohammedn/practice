# Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network Tutorial

This notebook contins a solution to a simple Reinforcement Learning problem, solved both using Q-Learning (using a table) and Deep Q-Network.

## The challenge:
The agent must fill all 4 vacant cells of the board. He must not try to fill a non-vacant cell. An empty cell is represented by "0" and a filled cell by "1". In the example
below, only the second cell is filled, and so the agent must select any of the other cells:
